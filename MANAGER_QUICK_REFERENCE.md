### **2. Check Workload Before Assigning**
Talent workload colors:
- 🟢 Green (0 tasks) = Perfect for new work
- 🔵 Blue (1-3 tasks) = Good capacity
- 🟡 Yellow (4-6 tasks) = Near limit
- 🔴 Red (7+ tasks) = Overloaded, avoid assigning

### **3. Approve Timesheets Daily**
Don't let them pile up! Quick daily approvals:
- Prevents talent delays
- Keeps hours accurate
- Builds trust

### **4. Log Hours Right After Completion**
When talent finishes work:
- Log immediately (while fresh)
- Add description of work done
- Keeps client dashboard current

### **5. Use Client Detail for Everything**
The Client Detail Modal is your command center:
- All client info in one place
- Quick actions for common tasks
- Complete activity timeline
- No need to navigate between pages

## 🆘 Common Issues

### **Issue: Template button grayed out**
**Cause:** No project selected OR no templates available
**Fix:** Seed templates or create one via API

### **Issue: Timesheet won't approve**
**Cause:** Time log might not belong to your client
